        FC Barcelona is one of the premier Football clubs in the world.<br>
        Many of the best players in history have donned the red and blue of Barcelona and made the Catalonian fans proud.<br>
         As a team, they have won countless of trophies and triumphed over rivals.<br>
         Much of their success can be credited to their renowned youth academy, La Maisa.<br>
         It has brought countless of talented players such as Messi, Iniesta, and Puyol throughout the ranks of La Maisa, the youth academy.<br>
        It was all started in 1899, after a man named Joan Gamper laid the foundation for FC Barcelona.<br>
      After building up a respectable squad, they started to compete in their first competitions.

        FC Barcelona is one of the most elite clubs in the world, 
        and it is almost impossible to imagine a world where FC Barcelona is not considered the gold standard of a soccer team.
         They may seem unstoppable right now, but in 2003, Barcelona looked like it was about to fall apart. 
         The Barcelona squad had not won the league since the 1998-99 season, 
        and it looked as if they would never win it again
